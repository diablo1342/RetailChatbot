<h1> RetailChatbot </h1>

## üìù Overview üìù

Retail Chatbot is a conversational AI application designed to assist customers with product inquiries, recommendations, and order-related questions. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide human-like responses, improving customer experience and reducing the need for manual support.

## How I built it
Model: Fine-tuned transformer-based NLP model (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, or GPT) for intent recognition and response generation.

Framework: Python with libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow for model training.

Data: Conversational dataset with labeled intents (greetings, product queries, order status, etc.).

Pipeline:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization).

Intent classification using deep learning.

Response generation via rule-based replies or retrieval-based responses.
